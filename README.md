# Chromosome-level genome assembly and structural variant analysis of two laboratory yeast strains from the Peterhof Genetic Collection lineage

This repository contains scripts and data used during the genome analysis of PGC yeast strains. A brief description of the files is given below:

`1A_merged_sorted.fasta` and `74D_merged_sorted.fasta` are the final assembly files submitted to NCBI. These assemblies will eventually appear at NCBI linked to BioSamples SAMN15777459 and SAMN15777460.

`quast_draw.R` script was used to plot major assembly statistics shown on Figure 1A.

`te_draw.R` scripts was used to prepare Figure 2.

`ena_draw.R` scripts was used to prepare Figure 4E.
