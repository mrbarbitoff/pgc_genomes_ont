# Chromosome-level genome assembly of yeast strains from the Peterhof Genetic Collection

This repository contains scripts and data used during the genome analysis of PGC yeast strains. A brief description of the files is given below:

`1A_merged_sorted.fasta` and `74D_merged_sorted.fasta` are the final assembly files submitted to NCBI. These assemblies will eventually appear at NCBI linked to BioSamples SAMN15777459 and SAMN15777460.

`quast_draw.R` script was used to plot major assembly statistics shown on Figure 1A.

`te_draw.R` scripts was used to prepare Figure 2.

`ena_draw.R` scripts was used to prepare Figure 4E.

`plot_aCGH` was used to prepare Figure S3.
